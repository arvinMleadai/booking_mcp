globs: **/*.{ts,tsx}

- Use Luxon's DateTime for all date manipulations to avoid native Date pitfalls.
- Leverage Luxon's formatting options for consistent date presentation.
- Utilize time zone support to handle user-specific date and time correctly.
- Avoid mutating DateTime objects; use immutable methods for safer code.
